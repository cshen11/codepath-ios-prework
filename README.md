### Some ideas to improve the app are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well

### App Brainstorming
Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
App: Instagram
- Changing the background color of the messages screen
- Deleting old messages

App: Facebook
- Creating groups
- Searching old messages and photos

App: Google Maps
- Providing navigations in real time
- Having several map types for viewing

An app I want to build is a travel app that people can record and share the photos they take when traveling. The features I want to implement are:
- Sharing photos and videos
- Adding location tag and time stamp
- Exclusive for travel
